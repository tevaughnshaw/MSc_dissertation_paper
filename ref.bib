	abstract = {Traditional commercial automated fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs) are vulnerable to fake attacks by the use of artificial fingerprints, due to its limitation on resolution and the difficulty of obtaining depth information. Developing new systems with strong anti-spoofing ability are of increasing concern in the current digital age. Inspired by the observation and comparison of fingertip skin structure and the one dimensional (1D) depth signals derived from OCT acquisition images between real finger and artificial fingerprints, two novel anti-spoofing features, namely depth-double-peak feature and sub-single-peak feature, were specifically defined. Depth-double-peak feature refers that there must be two and only two peaks in the 1D depth signal which reflects the double-peak structure of real fingertip skin. While sub-single-peak feature means that there must be a peak in the 1D depth signal intercepted before the maximum peak which distinguishes the extra layer covered on a real finger. Real and fake images could be presented by these two features and classified by a pre-learned threshold. Four types of artificial fingerprint, i.e., Normal Thickness Fingerprint Layer (NTFL), thin Fingerprint Layer (TFL), Ultra-Thin Fingerprint Layer (UTFL and Artificial Fingers Model (AFM) were collected to verify system robustness. 30 sets of real finger data (each set includes 400 images) and 60 sets of artificial fingerprint data (15 sets of each type) were collected by our designed OCT device. Experimental results show that our proposed anti-spoofing system could achieve 100\% accuracy over all four types of artificial fingerprints and outperform the other automated anti-spoofing method in comparison.},

It measures fingertip information on and beneath skin as 3D volume data, containing the surface fingerprint, internal fingerprint and sweat glands. Various methods have been proposed to extract internal fingerprints, which ignore the inter-slice dependence and often require manually selected parameters. In this article, a modified U-Net that combines residual learning, bidirectional convolutional long short-term memory and hybrid dilated convolution (denoted as BCL-U Net) for OCT volume data segmentation and two fingerprint reconstruction approaches are proposed. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that simultaneous and automatic extraction is performed for surface fingerprint, internal fingerprint and sweat gland. The proposed BCL-U Net utilizes the spatial dependence in OCT volume data and deals with segmentation of objects with diverse sizes to achieve accurate extraction. Comparisons have been performed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. A thorough evaluation of the recognition abilities of internal and surface fingerprints is conducted using a dataset significantly larger than previous studies. Four databases containing internal and surface fingerprints are generated from 1572 OCT volume data by the proposed method. The internal fingerprint matching experiment has achieved a lowest equal error rate (EER) of 0.95\%. Mixed internal and surface fingerprint matching experiment is also performed and achieves an EER of 3.67\%, verifying the consistency of the internal and surface fingerprints. The matching experiments for fingers under poor skin conditions show a 2.47\% EER of internal fingerprints that is much lower than that of surface fingerprints, which proves the advantage of internal fingerprints and indicates the potential of the internal fingerprints to supplement or replace the surface fingerprints for some specific applications.},

Methods have been proposed for OCT ﬁngerprint reconstruction. However, these methods have complex processing ﬂow and are time consuming. In this paper, an endto-end convolutional neural network based surface and internal ﬁngerprint reconstruction method is proposed. A simple yet effective contour regression module is proposed and integrated in the network for direct estimation of contours of stratum corneum and viable epidermis junction from noisy OCT volume data, thus greatly simplify the processing ﬂow. The proposed network further integrates multi-task learning with conventional segmentation task as auxiliary task and contour regression task as main task to facilitate the feature extraction and improve the robustness of the network. Depthwise separable convolution is adapted to a light-weight network for network computation complexity reduction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time that an end-to-end method is proposed for surface and internal ﬁngerprint extraction from noisy OCT volume data. Experiments and comparisons are carried out in terms of contour estimation accuracy, ﬁngerprint quality, ﬁngerprint matching performance and computation efﬁciency. Compared with conventional method, the proposed method utilizes only 6\% of original network parameters and 0.7\% of original computation time, but achieves comparably results. Fingerprint by depth proves the accuracy and robustness of contour regression than pixel-wise layer segmentation. The proposed method is noiseinsensitive, process-simple and time-efﬁcient for OCT ﬁngerprint reconstruction, which is signiﬁcant for real time application in Automated Fingerprint Recognition Systems.},

	abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT), as a noninvasive and high-resolution three-dimensional imaging technology, can capture biological tissue structure information under the skin of fingertips. This structure information facilitates stronger anti-spoofing capability of automatic fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs), and the reconstructed internal fingerprint images based on the structural information are more robust against poor skin conditions. Various internal fingerprint reconstruction methods have been proposed, but these approaches often ignore the continuity of spatial structure information, have a large number of model parameters and are sensitive to noise. Specific to these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight and noiserobust point detection network (LNPDN) to reconstruct internal fingerprints. At first, by combining the ShuffleNet with the temporal shift module and self-attention, the continuity of spatial information is considered. Meanwhile, the previous refined tissue structural region segmentation task, which is highly affected by noise, is transformed into an easy noise-robust feature point detection mission. Then, these detected points are synthesized into a curve to represent the upper envelope of the viable epidermis by linear interpolation. Finally, internal fingerprint image is reconstructed by averaging those pixel values at a certain depth range below the envelope. The experimental results show the proposed feature point extraction model for the central vertex of ridge blocks reaches the F1-score value of 93.911\%, and the average minimum point-segment distance between the proposed curve and the target curve is 1.475. It demonstrates that the proposed model can well extract the central vertex of the ridge blocks and the curve can reflect the location of the viable epidermis. We also compared the recognition capabilities of internal fingerprints extracted from 2138 OCT fingerprint volume data on the public OCT fingerprint benchmark dataset. Our method achieves the lowest equal error rate of 0.167\%, with a relative reduction of 60.91\% compared with state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.},

	abstract = {In current Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)-based fingerprint recognition systems, Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) and subsurface fingerprint reconstruction are treated as two independent branches, resulting in high computation and system building complexity. Therefore, this paper proposes a uniform representation model for simultaneous PAD and subsurface fingerprint reconstruction. A novel semantic segmentation network using attention mechanisms was designed to extract and segment multiple subsurface structures from real finger slices (i.e., B-scans). The latent codes derived from the network are directly used to effectively detect PA because they contain abundant subsurface biological information, which is independent of PA materials and has strong robustness for unknown PAs. Segmented subsurface structures were adopted to reconstruct multiple subsurface 2D fingerprints. Extensive experiments were carried out on an in-house database, which is the largest public OCT-based fingerprint database with 2449 volumes. PAD performance was evaluated by comparing the results of the existing methods with those of other segmentation networks. The proposed uniform representation model can obtain an accuracy (Acc) of 96.63\%, which achieves a state-of-theart performance. The effectiveness of subsurface reconstruction was evaluated from the segmentation and recognition results. In the segmentation experiments, the proposed method achieved the best results with an Intersection of Union (mIOU) of 0.834 and a Pixel Accuracy of 0.937. By comparing the recognition performance on surface 2D fingerprints (e.g., commercial and high-resolution), the lowest results with an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.25\% by minutiae matching and an EER of 5.42\% by pore matching are achieved, which indicates the excellent reconstruction capability of the proposed uniform representation model.},

	abstract = {Fingerprint friction ridge details are generally described in a hierarchical order at three different levels, namely, Level 1 (pattern), Level 2 (minutia points), and Level 3 (pores and ridge contours). Although latent print examiners frequently take advantage of Level 3 features to assist in identification, Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) currently rely only on Level 1 and Level 2 features. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) standard of fingerprint resolution for AFIS is 500 pixels per inch (ppi), which is inadequate for capturing Level 3 features, such as pores. With the advances in fingerprint sensing technology, many sensors are now equipped with dual resolution (500 ppi/1,000 ppi) scanning capability. However, increasing the scan resolution alone does not necessarily provide any performance improvement in fingerprint matching, unless an extended feature set is utilized. As a result, a systematic study to determine how much performance gain one can achieve by introducing Level 3 features in AFIS is highly desired. We propose a hierarchical matching system that utilizes features at all the three levels extracted from 1,000 ppi fingerprint scans. Level 3 features, including pores and ridge contours, are automatically extracted using Gabor filters and wavelet transform and are locally matched using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Our experiments show that Level 3 features carry significant discriminatory information. There is a relative reduction of 20 percent in the equal error rate (EER) of the matching system when Level 3 features are employed in combination with Level 1 and 2 features. This significant performance gain is consistently observed across various quality fingerprint images.},

To the best knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time that subcutaneous sweat pore extraction is investigated and proposed. Experiments on subcutaneous pore image reconstruction and sweat pore extraction are both conducted.

	abstract = {Traditional ﬁngerprint recognition systems are vulnerable to attacks, such as the use of artiﬁcial ﬁngerprints, and poor performance will be achieved if the captured surface ﬁngerprints are of low-quality. Developing high-security and robust ﬁngerprint recognition systems is of increasing concern in modern society. The introduction of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for ﬁngerprint imaging opens up a new research domain for ﬁngerprint recognition due to its ability to capture the depth information of skin layers. This paper proposes a ﬁngerprint recognition system based on OCT. The research ﬁrst establishes a database with normal, worn-out, artiﬁcial and degraded ﬁngerprints imaged by our custom-built, inhouse OCT device. Then, we propose to reconstruct three layers of subsurface ﬁngerprints by considering diverse skin layer information. For each of the subsurface ﬁngerprints divided according to the physical structure of the ﬁngertip, we propose a simple yet effective projection-based reconstruction method. Finally, a pixel-level fusion strategy based on the local image quality is proposed to the fuse the three levels of subsurface ﬁngerprints for robust ﬁngerprint recognition. In our experiments, we show that as much diverse ﬁngerprint information can be retained as possible by the proposed subsurface ﬁngerprint reconstruction method. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and eﬃciency of the proposed method by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art internal ﬁngerprint reconstruction approaches. The robustness and high anti-spooﬁng ability of the proposed system is veriﬁed by comparing the matching performance evaluated on the established OCT-based database and another database with the same ﬁngerprints imaged by a commercial optical sensor. The best EER and FMR100 evaluated on OCT-based ﬁngerprints are 0.42\% and 0.36\%, respectively. The best EER and FMR100 evaluated on traditional 2D surface ﬁngerprints are 8.05\% and 18.18\%, respectively, which shows the vast potential of the proposed system in current automated ﬁngerprint recognition systems (AFRSs).},

This paper proposes a novel high-resolution ﬁngerprint representation method for recognition based on only one fully convolutional network. By guiding the network to learn the most discriminative representation (i.e., sweat pores) and to reconstruct the original ﬁngerprint image, pore maps and hidden features are provided simultaneously to represent the high-resolution ﬁngerprint image for the subsequent direct matching process. The experimental results, which are evaluated on the public PolyU pore database, show that the best average RT, which is 94.88\%, can be obtained using our proposed method. In addition, the recognition results show that our proposed method achieves matching equal error rates (EERs) of 5.55\% and 1.27\% on the PolyU DBI and DBII databases, respectively, which is better than other pore detection methods when using the same matching method. Compared with the latest DeepPoreID method which split ﬁngerprint representation into pore extraction and pore representation, our approach improves the EER by up to 50.98\% when evaluated on an in-house database, further demonstrating the outstanding generalization ability of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {The human fingertip can detect small tactile features with a spatial acuity roughly the width of a fingerprint ridge. However, how individual ridges deform under contact to support accurate and high-precision tactile feedback is currently unknown. The complex mechanical structure of the glabrous skin, composed of multiple layers and intricate morphology within which mechanoreceptors are embedded, makes this question challenging. Here, we used optical coherence tomography to image and track sub-surface deformations of hundreds of individual fingerprint ridges during contact events at high spatial resolution in vivo. We calculated strain patterns in both the stratum corneum and viable epidermis in response to a variety of tactile stimuli, including static indentation, stick-to-slip events, sliding of a flat surface in different directions, and interaction with small tactile features, such as edges and grooves. We found that ridges could stretch, compress, and undergo considerable shearing orthogonal to the skin surface, but there was limited horizontal shear. Therefore, it appears that the primary components of ridge deformation and, potentially, neural responses are deformations of the ridge flanks and their relative movement, rather than overall bending of the ridges themselves. We conclude that the local distribution of mechanoreceptors across the ridges might be ideally suited to extract the resulting strain gradients and that the fingertip skin may possess a higher mechanical spatial resolution than that of a single ridge.},

OCT can function as a type of optical biopsy and is a powerful imaging technology for medical diagnostics because unlike conventional histopathology which requires removal of a tissue specimen and processing for microscopic examination, OCT can provide images of tissue in situ and in real time.OCT can be used where standard excisional biopsy is hazardous or impossible, to reduce sampling errors associated with excisional biopsy, and to guide interventional procedures.In this paper, we review OCT technology and describe its potential biomedical and clinical applications.

However, the performance of a minutiae extraction algorithm relies heavily on the quality of the input fingerprint images. In order to ensure that the performance of an automatic fingerprint identification/verification system will be robust with respect to the quality of input fingerprint images, it is essential to incorporate a fingerprint enhancement algorithm in the minutiae extraction module. We present a fast fingerprint enhancement algorithm, which can adaptively improve the clarity of ridge and valley structures of input fingerprint images based on the estimated local ridge orientation and frequency. We have evaluated the performance of the image enhancement algorithm using the goodness index of the extracted minutiae and the accuracy of an online fingerprint verification system. Experimental results show that incorporating the enhancement algorithm improves both the goodness index and the verification accuracy.},

	abstract = {The performance of a fingerprint matching system is affected by the nonlinear deformation introduced in the fingerprint impression during image acquisition. This nonlinear deformation causes fingerprint features such as minutiae points and ridge curves to be distorted in a complex manner. A technique is presented to estimate the nonlinear distortion in fingerprint pairs based on ridge curve correspondences. The nonlinear distortion, represented using the thin-plate spline (TPS) function, aids in the estimation of an “average” deformation model for a specific finger when several impressions of that finger are available. The estimated average deformation is then utilized to distort the template fingerprint prior to matching it with an input fingerprint. The proposed deformation model based on ridge curves leads to a better alignment of two fingerprint images compared to a deformation model based on minutiae patterns. An index of deformation is proposed for selecting the “optimal” deformation model arising from multiple impressions associated with a finger. Results based on experimental data consisting of 1,600 fingerprints corresponding to 50 different fingers collected over a period of two weeks show that incorporating the proposed deformation model results in an improvement in the matching performance.},

	abstract = {Presentation attack detection (PAD) is a critical component of automated fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs). However, existing PAD technologies based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) mainly rely on local information, ignoring the global continuity and correlation of physiological structures. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate presentation attack instruments (PAIs) that cater to the unique OCT characteristics leads to the insufficient evaluation of PAD. The identification features, including external fingerprint (EF), internal fingerprint (IF), and subcutaneous sweat pore (SSP), provide valuable information about the intrinsic connections of physiological structures. Such intrinsic connections hold potential clues for PAD. Building upon this premise, this paper proposed a novel PAD method based on three OCT hand-crafted features: EF-IF self-matching score (SMS), SSP number (SN), and SSP coincidence rate (SCR). These simple yet effective PAD features offer a more precise and detailed description of the internal physiological structure, enabling accurate distinction between presentation attack (PA) and bona-fide. The proposed method achieves a 4\% Equal Error Rate (EER), significantly outperforming other existing PAD methods. Additionally, the cross-device experiment demonstrates the generalization capability of the proposed method on both our dataset and the public OCT dataset.},

Traditional surface sweat pores become unclear or disappeared when the ﬁnger is contaminated, dried, or damaged. These unstable factors create major challenges in collecting sweat pores. Subcutaneous sweat glands belong to the internal tissues of ﬁngers, which are stable and immune to external disturbances. This study investigated the extraction of subcutaneous sweat glands from ﬁngertip volume data collected by optical coherence tomography (OCT). First, an improved multitask V-Net is proposed to extract subcutaneous sweat glands from OCT volume data. The network has an encoding path for features extraction and two decoding paths for extracting sweat gland boundaries and regions, respectively. The multitask scheme is designed to enhance the boundary and shape information of sweat glands and to prevent false extraction caused by interference from other tissues. Second, three mapping methods are proposed to address the problem of different spatial orientations of sweat glands. These three mapping methods, namely, global direct mapping (GDM), local direct mapping (LDM), and cylindrical ﬁtting mapping (CFM), are used to map sweat glands to the surface ﬁngerprint. Experiments are conducted in terms of sweat gland extraction, mapping, and matching. The qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed network for sweat glands extraction outperforms other methods and that the LDM and CFM methods derive more accurate positions of sweat glands on the surface ﬁngerprint than GDM. In the matching experiment, the equal error rate (EER) of dual-decoding V-Net (DDVN) reached 0.58\%, which veriﬁed the recognition ability of sweat glands and the effectiveness of the proposed network.},

Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images.

The implementation performs on-the-ﬂy elastic deformations for eﬃcient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required.

In particular, sweat pores can be used for quality assessment, liveness detection, biometric matching in live applications, and matching of partial latent ﬁngerprints in forensic applications. Currently, each type of ﬁngerprint acquisition technique (touch-based, touchless, or latent) requires a different algorithm for pore extraction.

	abstract = {Abstract
            During the various stages of shock loading, many transient modes of deformation can activate and deactivate to affect the final state of a material. In order to fundamentally understand and optimize a shock response, researchers seek the ability to probe these modes in real-time and measure the microstructural evolutions with nanoscale resolution. Neither post-mortem analysis on recovered samples nor continuum-based methods during shock testing meet both requirements. High-speed diffraction offers a solution, but the interpretation of diffractograms suffers numerous debates and uncertainties. By atomistically simulating the shock, X-ray diffraction, and electron diffraction of three representative BCC and FCC metallic systems, we systematically isolated the characteristic fingerprints of salient deformation modes, such as dislocation slip (stacking faults), deformation twinning, and phase transformation as observed in experimental diffractograms. This study demonstrates how to use simulated diffractograms to connect the contributions from concurrent deformation modes to the evolutions of both 1D line profiles and 2D patterns for diffractograms from single crystals. Harnessing these fingerprints alongside information on local pressures and plasticity contributions facilitate the interpretation of shock experiments with cutting-edge resolution in both space and time.},

	abstract = {The research of external ﬁngerprint collected by total internal reﬂection (TIR) has been carried out for decades and the research of internal ﬁngerprint collected by optical coherence tomography (OCT) has just begun. The internal ﬁngerprint can be hardly affected by the ﬁnger surface status, due to its strong antiinterference and antispooﬁng ability, which can serve as a powerful supplement to external ﬁngerprint. However, matching ﬁngerprints acquired in different ways can lead to a drop in ﬁngerprint recognition accuracy due to the differences in ﬁngerprint quality, distortions, and detection areas. Whether the internal ﬁngerprint can be used to replace the external ﬁngerprint for direct identiﬁcation has been hampered by lacking comparison tools to study potential correlation with each other. To study the connection between internal and external ﬁngerprints, a synchronous acquisition system that achieves the same ﬁngerprint area measurement at the same time is necessary. The integration of different optical paths of TIR and OCT as well as the consequent distortion correction of two totally different imaging ways are two challenging problems. This article presents a ﬁngerprint acquisition system that synchronously acquires the external ﬁngerprint and internal ﬁngerprint with TIR and OCT, respectively. By using a self-designed trapezoidal prism, optical paths of TIR and OCT were integrated. Furthermore, a distortion correction method based on a grid calibration plate is used to remove distortions caused by two imaging methods. The ﬁngerprint quality statistics are illustrated in 264 sets of ﬁngerprint data sets. Identiﬁcation results show synchronous acquisition and distortion correction of the proposed system are efﬁcient.},

Optical coherence tomography can capture stable internal ﬁngerprints located inside ﬁngertips but with comparable unstable qualities. External and internal ﬁngerprints have advantages and disadvantages that can be used to complement each other. Registration is the premise of the fusion of these ﬁngerprints. Multisensor differences between external and internal ﬁngerprints, including image style differences and deformations, make the registration challenging. This paper presents a new multisensor ﬁngerprint registration method to align external and internal ﬁngerprints ﬁnely for the ﬁrst time. The proposed method includes two stages. First, a cycle generative adversarial network with a structural constraint is designed to unify the image style of multisensor ﬁngerprints. It can improve the similarity of ﬁngerprints while preserve the valley–ridge structures. Then, a two-step registration with fast digital image correlation and outlier rejection is proposed to realize global to local registration. Comparisons have been performed to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in registration accuracy and matching performance. Fingerprint fusion results also verify that the registration and fusion of external and internal ﬁngerprints are conducive to supplement ﬁngerprint information.},

Most of the existing pore extraction methods detect pores by using a static isotropic pore model; however, their detection accuracy is not satisfactory due to the limited approximation capability of static isotropic models to various types of pores. This paper presents a dynamic anisotropic pore model to describe pores more accurately by using orientation and scale parameters. An adaptive pore extraction method is then developed based on the proposed dynamic anisotropic pore model. The ﬁngerprint image is ﬁrst partitioned into well-deﬁned, ill-posed, and background blocks. According to the dominant ridge orientation and frequency on each foreground block, a local instantiation of appropriate pore model is obtained. Finally, the pores are extracted by ﬁltering the block with the adaptively generated pore model. Extensive experiments are performed on the high resolution ﬁngerprint databases we established. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect pores more accurately and robustly, and consequently improve the ﬁngerprint recognition accuracy of pore-based AFRS.},

This paper presents a pore feature-based approach for biometric recognition.

Thereafter, a CNN-based descriptor is computed for a patch around each detected pore.

	abstract = {With identity fraud in our society reaching unprecedented proportions and with an increasing emphasis on the emerging automatic personal identification applications, biometrics-based verification, especially fingerprint-based identification, is receiving a lot of attention. There are two major shortcomings of the traditional approaches to fingerprint representation. For a considerable fraction of population, the representations based on explicit detection of complete ridge structures in the fingerprint are difficult to extract automatically. The widely used minutiae-based representation does not utilize a significant component of the rich discriminatory information available in the fingerprints. Local ridge structures cannot be completely characterized by minutiae. Further, minutiae-based matching has difficulty in quickly matching two fingerprint images containing different number of unregistered minutiae points. The proposed filter-based algorithm uses a bank of Gabor filters to capture both local and global details in a fingerprint as a compact fixed length FingerCode. The fingerprint matching is based on the Euclidean distance between the two corresponding FingerCodes and hence is extremely fast. We are able to achieve a verification accuracy which is only marginally inferior to the best results of minutiae-based algorithms published in the open literature [1]. Our system performs better than a state-of-the-art minutiae-based system when the performance requirement of the application system does not demand a very low false acceptance rate. Finally, we show that the matching performance can be improved by combining the decisions of the matchers based on complementary (minutiae-based and filter-based) fingerprint information.},

However, performing a ﬁngerprint identiﬁcation over a large database can be an ineﬃcient task due to the lack of scalability and high computing times of ﬁngerprint matching algorithms. Fingerprint indexing is a key strategy in automatic ﬁngerprint identiﬁcation systems (AFISs) which allows us to reduce the number of candidates, the search space, and the occurrences of false acceptance in large databases. In this paper, an eﬃcient indexing algorithm is proposed using minutiae pairs and convex core point which employs k-means clustering and candidate list reduction criteria to improve the identiﬁcation performance. Our proposal can effectively reduce the search space and number of candidates for ﬁngerprint matching, and thus achieves higher eﬃciency and signiﬁcantly improves the system retrieval performance.

	abstract = {Fingerprint matching is an important and essential step in automated ﬁngerprint recognition systems (AFRSs). The noise and distortion of captured ﬁngerprints and the inaccurate of extracted features make ﬁngerprint matching a very difﬁcult problem. With the advent of high-resolution ﬁngerprint imaging techniques and the increasing demand for high security, sweat pores have been recently attracting increasing attention in automatic ﬁngerprint recognition. Therefore, this paper takes ﬁngerprint pore matching as an example to show the robustness of our proposed matching method to the errors caused by the ﬁngerprint representation. This method directly matches pores in ﬁngerprints by adopting a coarse-to-ﬁne strategy. In the coarse matching step, a tangent distance and sparse representationbased matching method (denoted as TD-Sparse) is proposed to compare pores in the template and test ﬁngerprint images and establish one-to-many pore correspondences between them. The proposed TD-Sparse method is robust to noise and distortions in ﬁngerprint images. In the ﬁne matching step, false pore correspondences are further excluded by a weighted RANdom SAmple Consensus (WRANSAC) algorithm in which the weights of pore correspondences are determined based on the dis-similarity between the pores in the correspondences. The experimental results on two databases of high-resolution ﬁngerprints demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve much higher recognition accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art pore matching methods.},

	abstract = {As a popular living ﬁngerprint feature, sweat pore has been adopted to build robust high resolution automated ﬁngerprint recognition systems (AFRSs). Pore matching is an important step in high resolution ﬁngerprint recognition. This paper proposes a novel pore matching method with high recognition accuracy. The method mainly solves the pore representation problem in the state-of-the-art direct pore matching method. By making full use of the diversity and large quantities of sweat pores on ﬁngerprints, deep convolutional networks are carefully designed to learn a deep feature (denoted as DeepPoreID) for each pore. The inter-class difference and intra-class similarity of pore patch pairs can be well solved using deep learning. The DeepPoreID is then used to describe the local feature for each pore and ﬁnally integrated into the classical direct pore matching method. More speciﬁcally, pore patches, which are cropped from both Query and Template ﬁngerprint images, are imported into the well-trained networks to generate DeepPoreID for pore representation. The similarity between those DeepPoreIDs are then obtained by calculating the Euclidian Distance between them. Subsequently, one-to-many coarse pore correspondences are established via comparing their similarity. Finally, classical Weighted RANdom SAmple Consensus (WRANSAC) is employed to pick true pore correspondences from coarse ones. The experiments carried on the two public high resolution ﬁngerprint database have shown the effectiveness of the proposed DeepPoreID, especially for ﬁngerprint matching with small image size. Meanwhile, better recognition accuracy is achieved by the proposed method when compared with the existing state-of-theart methods. About 35\% rise in equal error rate (EER) and about 30\% rise in FMR1000 when compared with the best result evaluated on the database with image size of 320 × 240 pixels.},

The proposed OCPAD model is learned from a training set only consists of Bonaﬁdes (i.e. real ﬁngerprints). The reconstruction error and latent code obtained from the trained auto-encoder network in the proposed model is taken as the basis for the following spoofness score calculation. To get more accurate reconstruction error, we propose an activation map based weighting model to further reﬁne the accuracy of reconstruction error. We test different statistics and distance measures and ﬁnally use a decision level fusion to make the ﬁnal prediction. Our experiments are performed using a dataset with 93200 bonaﬁde scans and 48400 PA scans. The results show that the proposed OCPAD can achieve a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 99.43\% when the False Positive Rate (FPR) equals to 10\% and a TPR of 96.59\% when FPR = 5\%, which signiﬁcantly outperformed a feature based approach and a supervised learning based model requiring PAs for training.},

The subtraction procedure results in a difference image, in which the pores are characterized by the lower magnitudes. After that, we perform a histogram equalization for enhancing pores and a global thresholding to obtain the pores as binary regions. Finally, such binary image is post-processed for removing false pore detections.

	abstract = {Due to the diversity of attack materials, ﬁngerprint recognition systems (AFRSs) are vulnerable to malicious attacks. It is thus important to propose effective ﬁngerprint presentation attack detection (PAD) methods for the safety and reliability of AFRSs. However, current PAD methods often exhibit poor robustness under new attack types settings. This paper thus proposes a novel channel-wise feature denoising ﬁngerprint PAD (CFD-PAD) method by handling the redundant noise information ignored in previous studies. The proposed method learns important features of ﬁngerprint images by weighing the importance of each channel and identifying discriminative channels and “noise” channels. Then, the propagation of “noise” channels is suppressed in the feature map to reduce interference. Speciﬁcally, a PAAdaptation loss is designed to constrain the feature distribution to make the feature distribution of live ﬁngerprints more aggregate and that of spoof ﬁngerprints more disperse. Experimental results evaluated on the LivDet 2017 dataset showed that the proposed CFD-PAD can achieve 2.53\% average classiﬁcation error (ACE) and a 93.83\% true detection rate when the false detection rate equals 1.0\% (TDR@FDR=1\%). Also, the proposed method markedly outperforms the best single-model-based methods in terms of ACE (2.53\% vs. 4.56\%) and TDR@FDR=1\%(93.83\% vs. 73.32\%), which demonstrates its effectiveness. Although we have achieved a comparable result with the state-of-theart multiple-model-based methods, there still is an increase in TDR@FDR=1\% from 91.19\% to 93.83\%. In addition, the proposed model is simpler, lighter and more efﬁcient and has achieved a 74.76\% reduction in computation time compared with the state-of-the-art multiple-model-based method.},

	abstract = {Pore extraction appears to play an important role in high resolution partial ﬁngerprint recognition and in applications involving large population or high security levels. In this paper, we introduce a novel pore extraction approach which takes into account a new relation concerning their spatial and photometric dependence. This relation is given locally by analyzing distinct pores according to their distance and contrast. We evaluate our approach on high resolution pore extraction database and in an application involving partial ﬁngerprint alignment. The proposed segmentation has proved to be quite general, simple and can accurately extract ﬁngerprint pores in real images with different ridge and valley widths. It is also very robust to noise and according to the considered experiments outperforms well-known state-of-art methods.},
